<p align="justify">Hey, welcome 👋🏼. I see you've found my <b><a href="https://github.com/JonnyPickard">GitHub Profile</a></b>. I'm a <b>Frontend Developer with around 7 years experience</b>, mainly using <b>React</b> & <b>Typescript</b>.

I love designing & implementing great user experiences, but my real passion & the reason I learnt to code was to make games. 👾 🎮

I'm heavily motivated by non-superficial ethical business practices and business leaders who lead with their morals.

Finally, I am a technological optimist, believing we can & should fix global & environmental issues with tech. Not to make individuals wealthier but to enable everyone to have a better quality of life. 🌱 🦁
